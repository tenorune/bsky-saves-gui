## 1. Purpose

The installer (`bsky-saves-install`) presents users with a native menu-bar icon plus a status panel. The panel should let users see, at a glance, the state of their backup library — and (in later phases) issue commands like refresh / export / backup-toggle changes without opening the GUI in a browser.

Because the data the panel shows is owned by `bsky-saves-gui` (browser-resident library state), and the panel is a native UI in the installer, the design needs cross-repo coordination: the GUI has to expose state in a form the panel can read, the helper (`bsky-saves`) sits between them as the transport, and the installer owns the panel UI.

This document captures the design that emerged from the v0.6.x release-cycle conversations and locks the contract for the three repos.

## 2. Audience and responsibilities

| Repo | What it owns in this design |
|---|---|
| `bsky-saves` | The helper daemon. New `POST /status`, `GET /status`, and `DELETE /status` endpoints in phase 1; the on-disk status-cache file for persist mode; an in-memory TTL slot for session mode; auth gating identical to other credentialed endpoints. |
| `bsky-saves-gui` | Pushing summary library stats to the helper at meaningful moments. Owns the payload contents (§4.4), the push trigger list (§4.3), the session-mode heartbeat (§4.3), and how library state is computed. |
| `bsky-saves-install` | The status panel UI. Polls `GET /status` and renders. Distinguishes "no snapshot yet", "active snapshot", and "stale snapshot" (where `updated_at` is older than a UI-defined threshold). In later phases, issues commands. |

Each repo owns its part of the contract. The three repos coordinate via this document.

## 3. Background: the storage model

The user's "library" can live in three independent places (the "three tiers" framing from the design discussion):

| Tier | Where | Writer | Visible to panel? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. On-disk inventory** (`saves_inventory.json`) | Local filesystem | `bsky-saves fetch` (CLI) | Yes (phase 3 — direct file read) |
| **2. GUI in-memory state** ("session" mode) | Browser tab's JS heap | GUI via helper-relayed fetches *or* Pyodide-fallback path | Only while the GUI is pushing (phase 1, with TTL — see §4.2) |
| **3. GUI persisted state** ("persist" mode) | Browser `localStorage` / IndexedDB / OPFS | Same | Yes (phase 1, persistent across helper restarts) |

For the typical installer user the library lives in tier 2 or 3 (they use the GUI; they don't run CLI commands). For the maintainer / power-user case the library may also live in tier 1, possibly multiple times for different handles. The phasing reflects which user-population each tier serves.

## 4. Phase 1 (MVP) — read-only status snapshot

**Goal:** the panel can display summary information about the user's library, derived from GUI-pushed status, persistable across helper restarts and panel-open sessions where the user has opted into persistence — and transient where the user has opted into session-only privacy.

### 4.1 Data flow

```
GUI                       Helper                            Panel (installer)
─── POST /status ─────►   ┌─────────────────────┐
                          │ in-memory snapshot  │  ◄── GET /status ─── (poll)
                          │                     │
                          │ persist mode:       │
                          │   atomic-write ↓    │
                          └─────────────────────┘
                                   │
                                   ▼
                          <config_dir>/bsky-saves/status.json
                                   ▲
                              load on
                              helper startup
                              (persist mode only)
```

The helper is a state-cache proxy: it holds the latest status the GUI reported. In persist mode it mirrors that to a small file on disk so it survives helper restarts. In session mode it holds it in memory with a TTL that expires when the GUI's heartbeats stop. Either way, `GET /status` serves whatever the current state is.

### 4.2 Helper-side surface (`bsky-saves` repo)

**`POST /status`** — GUI pushes here.

- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (same as every other credentialed endpoint).
- Request body: JSON; structure in §4.4. The helper validates basic shape (presence of required keys, types) and rejects with 400 on malformed.
- Response: `204 No Content` on accept.
- Concurrency: last-write-wins (see [R3](./installer-status-panel-resolved.md#r3--multiple-gui-sessions-on-one-helper)). The payload always carries `did` so per-DID indexing is a forward-compatible upgrade.
- **Mode-dependent storage** (the privacy-critical bit):
  - When `storage.mode === "persist"` (default), the helper updates its in-memory copy AND atomic-writes the on-disk mirror at `<config_dir>/bsky-saves/status.json`. Snapshot survives helper restart (loaded into memory on startup).
  - When `storage.mode === "session"`, the helper updates its in-memory copy ONLY — no disk write — and applies a TTL whose value comes from the payload's `storage.session_ttl_seconds`. Each subsequent push from the same DID refreshes the TTL. When the TTL expires with no refresh, the helper drops the in-memory snapshot.
  - The two storage tiers (memory-session, disk-persist) are independent. A session-mode push does NOT overwrite a previously written persist-mode disk snapshot from a different sign-in. Implementer's note: a simple model is `{ memory_snapshot, memory_expires_at, disk_snapshot }`. Reads (`GET /status`) prefer unexpired memory, fall back to disk, return 404 if neither exists.

The mode-dependent split honors the GUI's persist-vs-session privacy contract: a session-mode user closes their browser expecting "this browser keeps no record"; the heartbeat-driven TTL ensures the helper drops the snapshot within ~60s of tab close, and nothing was ever written to disk.

**`GET /status`** — installer polls here.

- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Response: `200` with the most recent unexpired payload as JSON, or `404` if no status has ever been pushed (or the in-memory session-mode snapshot has expired and no persist-mode disk snapshot exists).
- Caching: helper holds the value in memory; reads are cheap. No need for ETag / conditional-GET; polling cadence is the rate limiter.

**`DELETE /status`** — GUI calls this on explicit clear ("Clear all data").

- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Effect: helper drops the in-memory snapshot for the calling DID AND removes the on-disk mirror file (if present). Subsequent `GET /status` returns 404 until the next push.
- Response: `204 No Content`.
- Rationale: sign-out alone is not a clear — the GUI preserves the user's local library state across sign-out (signing back in resumes the same library). Only the GUI's explicit "Settings → Clear all data" action invokes this endpoint. See [R5](./installer-status-panel-resolved.md#r5--clear-path-semantics) for the design rationale.

**`<config_dir>/bsky-saves/status.json`** — persistence mirror (persist mode only).

- Same directory as the token file (`status.json` sibling to `token`).
- File perms: `0600` (matches the token file's threat model — the status payload carries handle info worth keeping out of other users' reads).
- Written via the existing `atomic_write_inventory` pattern (temp + `os.replace`).
- Loaded into the helper's in-memory cache on startup; if file missing, in-memory cache starts empty.
- NOT written in session mode. The file's presence reflects exactly one user history: a persist-mode push happened, the daemon now caches it across restarts.

### 4.3 GUI-side surface (`bsky-saves-gui` repo)

The GUI is responsible for **what** to push and **when**.

**Push triggers — REQUIRED:**

- After every successful fetch of saves (completion of the inventory delta).
- After each per-asset hydration phase finishes (threads, images, articles).
- On user toggling any of {threads, images, articles} on or off.
- On successful sign-in (initial snapshot carrying the new DID).
- On "Settings → Clear all data" — sends `DELETE /status` rather than a regular push.

**Push triggers — REQUIRED in session mode:**

- Idle heartbeat at a cadence shorter than the helper's session TTL (e.g., heartbeat every 15s when TTL is 60s — see Q6). This keeps the helper's in-memory session-mode snapshot alive while the tab is open. In persist mode the heartbeat is optional (no TTL to keep alive).

**Sign-out:**

- Stop the push loop. Do NOT send `DELETE /status`. The user's local library survives sign-out (per the GUI's existing persistence contract); the helper's snapshot should track that. For session mode, the helper's TTL naturally expires the snapshot within ~60s. For persist mode, the snapshot stays in place until a future "Clear all data" or new sign-in with a different DID.

**Account switch (sign out → sign in with different account):**

- Implicit. The next push from the new account carries a different `did`; single-slot last-write-wins overwrites the previous account's snapshot cleanly. No special handling in phase 1.

**Push rate limiting (debouncing):**

- The GUI batches/coalesces pushes so that no more than one push is in flight per ~500ms (proposed; see Q5). A burst of state changes during hydration (e.g., 10 images completed per second from the underlying Svelte store updates) generates at most ~2 pushes per second, with the most recent state always carried forward. The cadence floor is a GUI implementation detail; the contract guarantees the helper won't be hit at JS-store-update rate.

**Failure handling:**

- A failed push (network error, helper down, 4xx/5xx) is non-fatal. The GUI logs at debug level (one line per failure burst, not per attempt) and continues. The next successful push overwrites whatever stale state the helper might be holding.
- A 401 with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` from `POST /status` is handled by the existing pairing-401 path (`markPairingStale` → re-pair UX). No special-casing for status pushes — they participate in the same auth model as `/fetch`, `/enrich`, etc.

**Pyodide-fallback mode (no helper, hosted PWA without a paired daemon):**

- Skip the push entirely. The panel — if anyone is viewing it from a previous paired session — shows whatever was last pushed, with a stale timestamp surfacing the staleness. See [R4](./installer-status-panel-resolved.md#r4--pyodide-fallback-mode).

### 4.4 Status payload shape (phase 1)

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "updated_at": "2026-05-17T20:15:00Z",
  "current_state": "idle",
  "library": {
    "handle": "alice.bsky.social",
    "did": "did:plc:abc123…",
    "total_saves": 1247,
    "by_status": {
      "synced": 1230,
      "lost": 15,
      "unsaved": 2
    }
  },
  "hydration": {
    "articles": {"completed": 973, "total": 1247},
    "threads":  {"completed": 412, "total": 1247},
    "images":   {"completed": 856, "total": 1247}
  },
  "storage": {
    "mode": "persist",
    "session_ttl_seconds": null,
    "browser_bytes_estimate": 18234567
  },
  "last_activity": {
    "kind": "fetch",
    "started_at": "2026-05-17T20:13:11Z",
    "finished_at": "2026-05-17T20:15:00Z",
    "added": 3,
    "removed": 0,
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

Field-level notes:

- `schema_version` — integer; bumps on non-backward-compatible payload changes. The panel reads older schemas and degrades gracefully (display what it understands, ignore what it doesn't).
- `updated_at` — ISO-8601 UTC; helps the panel surface staleness when the GUI hasn't pushed recently.
- `current_state` — one of `"idle"`, `"refreshing"`, `"hydrating"`, `"error"`. The panel uses this to show a live spinner during in-flight work without having to infer from `last_activity.finished_at`. `"error"` means the most recent activity failed; details in `last_activity.errors`.
- `library` — minimal identity + counts. `did` is required from sign-in onward (drives last-write-wins single-slot today, per-DID indexing later). `by_status` mirrors the v0.6.0 retention categories. Always present once the user is signed in and has a non-empty inventory.
- `hydration` — per-feature completion. Each entry is `{completed, total}`. Optional sections; absent entries mean the GUI can't cheaply compute that metric.
- `storage.mode` — `"session"` or `"persist"`. Drives the helper's storage decision (§4.2). Required.
- `storage.session_ttl_seconds` — integer; required when `mode === "session"`, null/absent in persist mode. The TTL the helper applies to its in-memory snapshot before dropping. Typical: 60s.
- `storage.browser_bytes_estimate` — `navigator.storage.estimate()` result if available; null otherwise. Informational; helps the panel show approximate disk footprint.
- `last_activity.kind` — `"fetch" | "hydrate_articles" | "hydrate_threads" | "hydrate_images" | "manual_refresh" | "idle"`. The panel renders e.g. "Last activity: fetch · 2 min ago · +3 / −0."
- `last_activity.errors` — array of `{kind: string, message: string, count: number}` objects. `kind` is a short stable identifier (e.g., `"pds_timeout"`, `"helper_504"`, `"thread_fetch_failed"`); `message` is human-readable; `count` is the multiplicity within this activity. Empty array means no errors. The panel can render counts and tooltip the messages.

Fields are optional except where noted; the GUI omits sections it can't cheaply compute. The panel renders only what's present.

### 4.5 Panel-side surface (`bsky-saves-install` repo)

The panel polls `GET /status` at a low rate while open (≤ once every 5 seconds is plenty given humans don't watch dashboards updating at sub-second granularity), authenticates with the same session token it already holds from pairing, renders the fields.

UI choices live entirely in the installer repo. Suggested defaults: counts as numerals, hydration as bar gauges, `updated_at` rendered as "12 min ago" relative time, `current_state === "refreshing"` as a small spinner.

When `GET /status` returns 404 — no snapshot yet, or session-mode snapshot expired — panel displays a placeholder ("No active library status — open the GUI and run a fetch") with a button that opens the bundled GUI URL.

Staleness handling: if `updated_at` is older than a panel-defined threshold (e.g., 5 minutes), the panel renders the values with a subtle "last seen N min ago" indicator. The panel does NOT poll-with-backoff; the helper's TTL is the authoritative liveness signal for session mode, and persist-mode snapshots are expected to persist (the user is OK with the data lingering).

### 4.6 Authentication and trust

All three endpoints (`POST /status`, `GET /status`, `DELETE /status`) sit behind the existing `_check_token` middleware introduced in v0.6.2. Same `Authorization: Bearer <token>` semantics as `/fetch`, `/auth/check`, etc. Same `WWW-Authenticate` shaping on 401 (per v0.6.5's add) so the GUI's 401-interceptor handles them identically.

The trust boundary is unchanged: anyone who can read `<config_dir>/bsky-saves/token` can call these endpoints; same as today.

## 5. Phase 2 — commands from panel to GUI

Out of phase-1 scope. Sketch only — full design in a follow-up doc when phase 2 is on deck.

**Use cases:** refresh button, export library, backup-toggle changes (threads / articles / images on/off).

**Two candidate patterns:**

1. **Helper-held command queue, GUI polls.** Panel `POST /commands` writes into the queue; GUI periodically `GET /commands?since=<id>` pulls pending; GUI acks via `POST /commands/ack`. Simple; ~3–5s latency depending on poll cadence.
2. **Server-Sent Events from helper to GUI.** GUI opens `GET /commands/stream` once at startup; helper pushes commands via SSE; sub-second latency. Adds a long-lived connection to the helper. The browser's `EventSource` API handles reconnection automatically.

Phase-2 design will pick one (likely (1) first, escalate to (2) if UX requires it).

## 6. Phase 3 — CLI inventories

Also out of phase-1 scope. Sketch only.

For users who run `bsky-saves fetch` and have a tier-1 on-disk inventory (the maintainer's flow; some power users), the panel should be able to display its stats alongside or instead of GUI-pushed status.

Likely shape: the helper accepts an optional `--inventory <path>` flag at startup. When configured, `GET /status` returns a payload that includes both GUI-reported library state (if any) and on-disk inventory stats (if any). The panel UI shows them as separate cards.

Multi-handle / multi-inventory edge cases (the maintainer setup explicitly hits these) come into play here; phase-3 design will need to decide:

- Single configured path vs. list of paths the panel can switch between.
- How to disambiguate when the GUI's reported `did` differs from the configured-inventory's `did`.
- Whether the snapshot keying upgrades from single-slot to per-DID at this point (likely yes).

## 7. Open questions (phase 1)

Numbered for ease of reference. Answers go inline once locked; resolved items move to [`installer-status-panel-resolved.md`](./installer-status-panel-resolved.md) with a backlink from the section they inform.

**Q5 — Push debouncing rate** *(raised by GUI 2026-05-18)*. GUI proposes max one push per 500ms (see §4.3). CLI team: does this match what the helper's HTTP stack can comfortably handle, or should the floor be tighter (250ms / 1s)? If 500ms is fine, this gets folded into §4.3 as the canonical floor.

**Q6 — Session-mode heartbeat cadence and TTL** *(raised by GUI 2026-05-18)*. GUI proposes 15s heartbeat / 60s TTL (4× safety margin against a single missed push). CLI team: any preference on the TTL value? Longer TTL = more tolerance for network blips; shorter = quicker cleanup after tab close. Whatever's chosen, the heartbeat should be ≤ TTL/3 to survive a missed push.

**Q7 — Persist-mode disk-write frequency** *(raised by GUI 2026-05-18)*. Per §4.2, the helper atomic-writes to disk on every persist-mode push. For a heavy hydration phase (~2 pushes/second from §4.3 debouncer) that's a lot of disk writes. Is this OK, or does the helper want to coalesce writes (e.g., flush at most once per second, with a final write triggered by a `priority: "final"` hint the GUI can send on `beforeunload`)?

**Q8 — Installer poll cadence** *(raised by GUI 2026-05-18 for installer team)*. §4.5 suggests ≤ once per 5 seconds. Installer team: what cadence works best with idle-friendly power management on macOS / Windows? Slower polls (e.g., 10s) are friendlier to battery; faster (1–2s) feels more "live" to the user. Or: switch cadence based on whether the panel is currently visible / focused?

## 8. Maintenance

This document is the cross-repo contract. Any of the following changes should be accompanied by a PR updating this doc:

- Adding / removing fields from the status payload.
- Changing the auth shape, endpoint paths, or response codes.
- Bumping `schema_version`.
- Moving items between phases.
- Resolving the open questions in §7.

Reviewers ideally include one maintainer from each affected repo.

The doc lives in `bsky-saves-coordination` (a neutral fourth repo) because the contract is symmetric across the three primary repos; no single team's repo should host it.

When the design changes substantively (e.g., adopting phase 2's command flow), branch this doc into a phase-2 doc rather than retrofitting the phase-1 contract.

## 9. Changelog

| Date | Author | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-17 | CLI | Initial draft (§§1–8 + Appendices A–B). Open questions Q1–Q4 surfaced. |
| 2026-05-18 | GUI | Session-mode privacy: added mode-dependent storage to §4.2 (memory-only + TTL for session, atomic disk write for persist). Added `current_state` field and `storage.session_ttl_seconds` to §4.4 payload. Clarified `last_activity.errors` shape. Made §4.3 push triggers explicit (required vs. mode-required). Added `DELETE /status` endpoint to §4.2 for explicit "Clear all data" path; clarified that sign-out is NOT a clear. Documented push debouncing floor. Raised Q5–Q8. Resolved Q1–Q4 in body; resolved appendix seeded with R1–R5. |

## Appendix A — Decisions still to make before implementation starts

A condensed checklist for whoever drives phase 1 to ground. None of these are open design questions; they're sequencing-and-ownership decisions.

- [ ] Confirm helper-side endpoints (`POST /status`, `GET /status`, `DELETE /status`) and persistence path with the `bsky-saves` maintainer.
- [ ] GUI team commits to the §4.4 payload shape (or proposes amendments). Section 7 open questions Q5–Q8 resolved.
- [ ] Installer team confirms polling cadence (Q8) and UI rendering pass.
- [ ] Spec docs open in each primary repo (`docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-status-snapshot.md` per the project convention); plan docs follow; implementation goes through the existing subagent-driven-development flow.
- [ ] Coordinated release: helper version that ships the endpoints, GUI version that ships the push call, installer version that ships the panel. All three pinned together in the installer's bundle.

## Appendix B — Glossary

- **CLI** — the `bsky-saves` command and its subcommands (`fetch`, `hydrate`, `enrich`, `serve`, `token`).
- **Helper** — the long-running HTTP daemon started by the `bsky-saves serve` CLI subcommand. Listens on `127.0.0.1:47826`.
- **GUI** — the `bsky-saves-gui` Svelte/Vite static web app, distributed both bundled into the `bsky-saves` wheel and hosted at `https://saves.lightseed.net`.
- **Panel** — the status UI in the `bsky-saves-install` native menu-bar app.
- **Library** — the user's collection of bookmarked saves, regardless of which storage tier holds it.
- **Status / status payload** — the JSON object the GUI pushes to the helper to describe library state for panel consumption. Defined in §4.4.
- **Persist mode / session mode** — the user's privacy choice at sign-in. Persist: data survives browser quit (IndexedDB / disk). Session: data wiped at tab close (sessionStorage / memory only). The helper's storage behavior in §4.2 mirrors this distinction.
